# VIP Servers

{% hint style="success" %}
GetBeaned main features are free and will always be. VIP servers are available for admins that want more customization.
{% endhint %}

### What are VIP servers ?

VIP servers are servers that can access more advanced functions, such as

* Bad-words style filtering of **messages** and user**names/**nick**names** with custom lists and optional [regexes](https://regex101.com)
* Extended history of actions \(who, and when, edited what\)
* More features on request \(`+suggest`\)

To get a VIP server, you have to be added as a Donator on the GetBeaned server. There is **no donation minimum** to be eligible for VIP servers. 

### Why aren't these available for normal, non-vip servers ?

Most of these features either could be abused or are work-intensive and require powerful servers. As I have to pay for the servers, this is a way for people to support the bot and gain access to advanced features as a thanks for supporting my work.

### I can't pay, can I still get a VIP server ?

Yes, please send a message explaining why you think you'd use one on the support server, we'll get back to you.
